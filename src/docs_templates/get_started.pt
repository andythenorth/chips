                        CHIPS is available from the OpenTTD online content service ('Bananas').
                    </p>
                    <p>If you are new to using the OpenTTD online content service, <a href="https://wiki.openttd.org/en/Manual/Online%20content">check out this guide (OpenTTD wiki).</a></p>

                    <h2>2. Setting up a game with CHIPS</h2>
                    <p class="lead">
                        A few things to know before setting up a CHIPS game...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        CHIPS includes additional railtypes, for example Narrow Gauge and Metro rails.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For players who want even more railtypes, CHIPS will also work with many grfs that add further railtypes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because CHIPS provides a <strong>lot</strong> of trains, it's recommended that the OpenTTD setting 'Vehicles never expire' is set to off.
                        This helps avoid over-crowding in the OpenTTD buy menu.
                    </p>
                    <p>CHIPS is not compatible with Inflation in OpenTTD.  Please ensure Inflation is turned off.</p>
                    <h3>Parameter settings (optional)</h3>
                    <p>Players can choose advanced options via parameter settings. It's also fine to ignore these.  Parameter options include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adjustable train cargo capacity</li>
                        <li>Simplified gameplay with fewer trains</li>
                        <li>Turn off CHIPS extra railtypes</li>
                        <li>Turn off freight wagon colour fading</li>
                        <li>Turn on wagons-only mode, for use with other grfs that are short on wagons</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>4. Tips, tricks and secret features</h2>
                    <h3>Company colour choices</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            CHIPS has full support for 2 company colours.
                            White is a recommended choice for the 2nd company colour (except for wagons), but it's fun to experiment with other combinations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Most wagons will switch between 1st and 2nd company colours if flipped in depot (use ctrl-click on the wagon).  Most wagons will also select random colour variations when built.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Cargo support</h3>
                    <p>CHIPS provides vehicles for a wide range of cargos, and should be compatible with all industry and cargo grfs.</p>
                    <p>Many wagons show cargo when loaded, and again a wide range of cargos are supported.</p>
                    <p>Autorefit (refit-at-stations) is supported for almost all vehicles.</p>
                    <h3>Secret features and other details</h3>
                    <p><em>Haulage bonus:</em> some electric railcars are allowed to increase their maximum speed when hauled by another engine that has a higher speed (or a faster express railcar).</p>
                    <p><em>Tail lights:</em> trains will show a rear light.</p>
                    <p><em>Magic appearance:</em> some vehicles will adapt their appearance depending on their position in the train, including passenger coaches, mail vans and intermodal wagons.</p>
                    <p><em>Integer length trains:</em> CHIPS vehicles have consistent length and it's very easy to make integer length trains (length will show in depot as 4.0, 6.0, 8.0 etc). This has minimal gameplay effect, but is good for people who have tidy-mind problems.</p>
                    <p><em>Bi-mode trains:</em> electro-diesel or similar engines will work with or without electricity.  Power is generally increased on electrified rails, and smoke or sparks will be show appropriately for current power type.</p>
                    <p><em>Brake vans / cabooses:</em> are just for eye-candy, and have no gameplay effect ;).</p>
